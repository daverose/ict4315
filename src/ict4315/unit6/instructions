Write a class called “Contact” that stores a person’s contact information.
The exact fields are up to you - it could be address, Google+ account, Twitter handle, email, business information, whatever.
You should make it have something useful but the only required field should be the contact’s name.
The constructor should be private and you should create instances of it using the Builder pattern.

Given the following interface:

public interface ContactWriter {
  void startContact(String name);
  void writeField(String field, String value);
  String finishContact();
}

create at least two implementations of it that output a Contact in different formats, e.g. HTML, XML, plain text, JSON, etc.
Create a method in Contact called writeContact(ContactWriter writer) that takes an instance of the interface and writes out the information contained in the Contact.

Write a Factory that returns the appropriate ContactWriter instance using a Factory Method. The factory should be a Singleton.

Write a Main class that creates a collection of Contact instances, gets a ContactWriter instance from the Factory and then writes the Contacts out.

For full credit write a set of unit tests for all classes except the Main class.
