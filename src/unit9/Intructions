Write a simple income tax calculator. There should be no application, no command line interaction, no main method, no GUI,
just the functionality. This is an exercise in design, interfaces and implementation. I do not expect you to implement the entire tax code;
a trivial implementation (worth no credit but that can form a base to get started with) would be to have a single class “IncomeTaxCalculator”
with methods “setIncome(int income)” and “int getTax()”. A more interesting implementation would have several setXXX() methods such as tax paid,
other income, deductions, etc. You should make use of other classes to provide calculation functionality - e.g. an “AmtCalculation” class.
Do not use double, float or any other decimal type. Either use dollars or pennies, but whichever you must round to the nearest whole number.

My general expectation is that you’ll have a central class that represents the tax calculator and its published interface.
This would then use several other classes, preferably via interfaces, to perform its calculations. I expect you to make this interesting,
and possibly even useful, but you should make no attempt to make it represent a real tax calculator. For example, on the one end if your tax calculation
is to simply be: “return income / 10;” you’ll get very little credit. On the other end, if you find yourself referring to the tax code or looking up
how it’s done in reality, then you’re spending too much time on it.

To receive any credit for this assignment you must write unit tests for every class you write.
